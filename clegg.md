# The Authority and Subversivenes of Print

Part I: Count off by fives and move into groups of 4-5 students. With your teammates, discuss what you think is Clegg's (1) research question; (2) central claim or argument; (3) secondary source evidence that supports this argument; and (4) primary source evidence that supports this argument.

Part II: Discuss how we might fit Milton's _Areopagitica_ into Clegg's argument as a primary source. How does it relate to her argument? How might it help us extend it?
