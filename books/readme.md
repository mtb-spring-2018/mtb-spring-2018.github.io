### In groups of 4-5 students, you will travel to Hillman library and locate/check out a physical book type item meeting each of the following criteria. It doesn't matter who checks out each item, as long as you are able to bring them to class on Tuesday. Make sure you keep of running list of which items match which criteria. If somehow a book matches more than one category, you may count it for up to three things. (Note: Some items might have to be requested from storage.)

- An item that reprints the full text of the U.S. constitution
- An item containing a politician's recipe for something
- An item containing a pre-1900 illustration of a Mark Twain character
- An item containing a post-1910 illustration of Sherlock Holmes
- A published walkthrough or description of how to cheat for a video game
- A published screenplay
- A facsimile edition of a literary classic
- A book published by B.W. Huebsch
- A Norton critical edition 
- A print bibliography of works about a common subject or written by a common author
- A novel with little plot summaries at the start of each chapter
- A book of poems, all of which are written by one poet 
- A ghostwritten autobiography
- A novel by a left handed author

Note: You will receive a 100% on this quiz if you participate fully. If your group is able to find every item, you will receive ten bonus points.  Otherwise, the number of successful finds will not affect your grade.
