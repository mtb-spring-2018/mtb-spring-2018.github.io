# To Create and Share a Folder on Box.com

1. Go to https://pitt.account.box.com/login and sign in using your Pitt credentials
2. Create a Folder by clicking "New" and then selecting "Folder"
3. The folder name will be [Yourlastname]_mtb-spring-2018, as in Lavin_mtb-spring-2018
4. Before clicking "OK", under collaboration, paste lavin@pitt.edu into the form field. Click "select access type" and change it to "co-owner"

# To submit an assignment

1. From inside the mtb-spring-2018 folder you created in the last step, create a new folder that includes the assignment title. For example: "Primary Document Report"
2. Upload the appropriate materials to the assignment subfolder. In most cases, this will be a word document. 
3. Make sure the Word document has a short, descriptive title with your name and the assignment name in it. For example, "Lavin Primary Document Report"
4. If you like, e-mail me to let me know you have updated your folder. This is not required, but it's a good idea to confirm that I've received your work.
